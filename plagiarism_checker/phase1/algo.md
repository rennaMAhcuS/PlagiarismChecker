Here's an algorithm that utilizes suffix arrays and the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array to find the longest approximate match between two vectors of integers. This algorithm ensures that the matched subsequence is at least 80% of the length of the longer vector.

### Algorithm: Longest Approximate Match Using Suffix Arrays and LCP

```python
def longestApproximateMatch(v1, v2):
    n = len(v1)
    m = len(v2)

    # Step 1: Concatenate v1 and v2 with a separator
    combined = v1 + [-1] + v2  # Using -1 as a unique separator
    combined_length = len(combined)

    # Step 2: Build the suffix array
    suffix_array = build_suffix_array(combined)

    # Step 3: Build the LCP array
    lcp_array = build_lcp_array(combined, suffix_array)

    # Step 4: Find the longest common substring with length at least 80%
    min_match_length = int(0.8 * max(n, m))
    best_length = 0
    best_start_index_v1 = -1
    best_start_index_v2 = -1

    # Create a list to track where each suffix belongs (v1 or v2)
    for i in range(combined_length):
        if suffix_array[i] < n:
            belong_to = 1  # Suffix comes from v1
            start_index_v1 = suffix_array[i]
            start_index_v2 = -1
        else:
            belong_to = 2  # Suffix comes from v2
            start_index_v1 = -1
            start_index_v2 = suffix_array[i] - (n + 1)  # Offset by length of v1 + separator

        # Check if the suffix belongs to different vectors
        if i > 0 and ((belong_to == 1 and suffix_array[i - 1] >= n) or
                       (belong_to == 2 and suffix_array[i - 1] < n)):
            # If the previous suffix comes from the other vector, check LCP
            length = lcp_array[i]
            if length >= min_match_length:
                if length > best_length:
                    best_length = length
                    best_start_index_v1 = start_index_v1 - length + 1 if start_index_v1 != -1 else -1
                    best_start_index_v2 = start_index_v2 - length + 1 if start_index_v2 != -1 else -1

    return best_length, best_start_index_v1, best_start_index_v2

def build_suffix_array(arr):
    # Implementing a simple suffix array construction
    n = len(arr)
    suffixes = sorted([(arr[i:], i) for i in range(n)])  # Sort the suffixes lexicographically
    return [suffix[1] for suffix in suffixes]

def build_lcp_array(arr, suffix_array):
    n = len(arr)
    rank = [0] * n
    lcp = [0] * (n - 1)

    # Build the rank array
    for i, suffix_index in enumerate(suffix_array):
        rank[suffix_index] = i

    # Compute the LCP array
    h = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if rank[i] > 0:
            j = suffix_array[rank[i] - 1]  # Previous suffix in the sorted order
            while (i + h < n and j + h < n and arr[i + h] == arr[j + h]):
                h += 1
            lcp[rank[i] - 1] = h  # Length of the LCP for this suffix
            if h > 0:
                h -= 1  # Reduce h for the next suffix comparison

    return lcp
```

### Explanation of the Algorithm Steps

1. **Concatenation**: The two vectors `v1` and `v2` are concatenated with a unique separator to differentiate between the two sources. This helps in building suffixes that can be traced back to their original source.

2. **Suffix Array Construction**:
   - The suffix array is built by sorting the starting indices of all suffixes of the combined vector. Each suffix is compared lexicographically.

3. **LCP Array Construction**:
   - The LCP array is built using the suffix array to determine the longest common prefix lengths between sorted suffixes.

4. **Finding Longest Approximate Match**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the suffix array and compares which suffixes come from `v1` and which come from `v2`.
   - If consecutive suffixes belong to different vectors, the LCP value is checked to see if it meets or exceeds the 80% length requirement.
   - If a longer match is found, the best length and start indices are updated.

### Time Complexity

- **Suffix Array Construction**: \(O((n + m) \log (n + m))\)
- **LCP Array Construction**: \(O(n + m)\)
- **Finding Matches**: \(O(n + m)\)

Overall, the time complexity is:
\[
O((n + m) \log (n + m))
\]
This approach is more efficient than the previous \(O(n \times m^2)\) method, particularly for large vectors.
